# PasswordManager

This is a small app that I built using Node.js (Express) to create a RestAPI.

The aplication is also connected to MySQL where I created a database with two different tables .
the user table have some basic information such as email , name and encrypted password.The other table 
contains the passwords that users create,read,update and delete.

Things you can do:

- CRUD passwords => the main goal here are keep passwords safe and get access to them at anytime.
- Users Account (Register/Login) => Different users can log in and each of them will have their own session


  
I am recntly working on JasonWebtoken to create an extra security layer within the app..


Hope you like it!!!
